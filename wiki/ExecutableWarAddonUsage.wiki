#summary Shows how to configure your maven project to build executable wars

== How to use the executable war addon ==

 * Add executable war setup - configures your maven project to build executable wars
{{{
roo> executable war setup
}}}
This will add jetty to your pom dependecies, will add ExecWar.java to your top package level directory and will update your maven assembly plugin to produce executable wars. 
 
 * Build an executable war:
{{{
roo> perform assembly
}}}
or directly from the command console:
{{{
 mvn assembly:assembly
}}}
This generates the standards XXXX.war application as well as an additional XXX-EXECWAR.war that can be executed as explained below or deployed in a web container. 

 * Execute the war
From the command line run
{{{
 java -jar XXX-EXECWAR.war 
}}}
Will start the application at: http://your-host:8080. You can set different port or context path like this:
{{{
 java -Dport=8081 -Dpath=app -jar XXX-EXECWAR.war 
}}}
Now the same application will be available at: http://your-host:8081/app
